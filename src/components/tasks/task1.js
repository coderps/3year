            Awesome mi amoooooor!!!! You have unlocked your first Jiaaa :)
            Our first year together was filled with adventures and sharing
            stuffs that nobody knows :wink: So, this Jiaaa is focussed on an
            adventure! Find the note hidden by Prax inside the pillow cover
            and read further, all the best :D
